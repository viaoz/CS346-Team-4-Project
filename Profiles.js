/* Dynamically Add Pet Profiles */
/*
When the home screen loads, pet profiles need to be added to the div that has an id of #pet-profiles
this can be something like: for each pet, add new 
    <div class="pet-profile <page-its-on>">
        <img src="pet-image" alt="pet profile picture">
        <h3>Pet Name</h3>
    </div>
this component i will add dynamic styling to based on its page (the <page-its-on> should be either PetProfilesPage or HomePage)
the same will be done for provider
if this can be modular (same function with variables allowing both to be accomplished without having duplicate code) that would be awesome but not necessary
